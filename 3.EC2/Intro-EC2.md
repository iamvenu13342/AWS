<h1> Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)</h1>

- EC2 is one of the virtual machine designed by amazon and it is fully **ELASTIC**
  
-Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) is a core service offered by AWS that provides resizable compute capacity in the cloud. 

-It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for **developers by providing scalable and elastic virtual servers.**


<h2>Key Features of Amazon EC2</h2>


1. **Scalability**:
   
   - **Elastic**: Easily scale up or down based on your application's needs.
     
   - **Auto Scaling**: Automatically adjusts the number of instances in response to the demand.
     

2. **Flexibility**:
   
   - **Instance Types**: A wide variety of instance types optimized for different workloads (e.g., compute-optimized, memory-optimized, storage-optimized).
     
   - **Operating Systems**: Supports multiple operating systems, including various distributions of Linux, Windows, and custom AMIs (Amazon Machine Images).
     

3. **Cost-Effective**:
   
   - **Pricing Models**: Multiple pricing options, including On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.
     
   - **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay only for the compute capacity you use.
     

4. **Security**:
   
   - **VPC**: Launch instances in a virtual private cloud for network isolation.
     
   - **IAM**: Fine-grained access controls using AWS Identity and Access Management.
     
   - **Security Groups**: Stateful firewall to control inbound and outbound traffic.
     

5. **Storage Options**:
    
   - **EBS (Elastic Block Store)**: Persistent block storage for EC2 instances.
     
   - **Instance Store**: Temporary block storage for ephemeral data.
     
   - **Elastic File System (EFS)**: Managed file storage service that can be mounted to multiple EC2 instances.
