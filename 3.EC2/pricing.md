<h1>EC2 Pricing Models</h1>


1. **On-Demand Instances**:
   
   - Pay for compute capacity by the hour or second with no long-term commitments.
     
   - Suitable for applications with unpredictable workloads.
     

2. **Reserved Instances**:
   
   - Commit to using EC2 for a one- or three-year term to receive a significant discount.
     
   - Best for steady-state workloads.
     

3. **Spot Instances**:
   
   - Purchase unused compute capacity at a lower price.
     
   - Suitable for flexible, fault-tolerant applications.
     

4. **Savings Plans**
   
   - Flexible pricing model offering lower prices in exchange for a commitment to a consistent amount of usage (measured in $/hour) for a one- or three-year period.
